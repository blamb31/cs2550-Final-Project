            satisfies the remainder of the requirements. The documentation
            should be in a file named documentation.html, with a link to the
            documentation file on the project description page.

          <td>
            I did this by creating the genHTML() function in the view.js file.
            It makes both of the grids that are used by the user and computer.
            It adds onclick events to the computer's board so the user can
            choose spaces. It is also styled by CSS depending on if a space is
            empty, a hit, or a miss

            An onclick event listener is added to all squares on the AI's game
            board. When the user clicks one of these a hit or miss is displayed

          <td>
            When a box on the AI's board is clicked or when the AI makes a
            guess, the value of the box is evaluated and the color and text of
            the box is changed depending on what the initial value was. This
            makes the HTML display a hit or a miss on the tables.

          <td>
            The starting values of each of the game grids are gotten from an
            XMLHttpRequest that returns a list of different possible grids in
            JSON. Then the ships are randomly placed by the program picking a
            grid randomly for each the AI and the user.
            <hr />
            The initial player turn is also loaded from the JSON object

            An audio tag and video tag are included at the top. The audio gives

            The video is an explosion. There are also two canvas tags that
            display stars. All of this happens when th first click on the page
            happens

            Game logic code
          </td>
          <td>
            There was a lot of game logic here.
            <ol>
              <li>
                The game boards are randomly chosen for each the AI and the
                player
              </li>
              <li>
                When a square is clicked on the AI's board the value of the
                square is checked, and if its is a ship, the square changes to a
                hit, if it was not a ship, it changes to a miss. If it was a
                hit, the program checks for a winner, if no winner the player is
                still up. If its a miss then it changes to the AI's turn
              </li>
              <li>
                The AI automatically makes a pick 250 ms after it is the AI's
                turn. Initially the AI picks a random square to "shoot". If it
                is a hit, the square is recorded the program checks for a
                winner, if no winner then the AI shoots again at surrounding
                squares of the square that was alrady a hit. This continues
                until the ship is sunk. When a ship is sunk, it alerts the user.
              </li>
              <li>
                Checking for a winner. Each time a hit is recorded the program
                looks at the model of each grid. If either grid has no 1's on
                it, then the game continues, otherwise the game is over, the
                winner is saved and displayed.
              </li>
              <li>
                When the chosen square is a miss, the turn is changed to the
                other player. If the AI is up, it automatically "shoots".
              </li>
              <li>
                The AI was pretty difficult to write. It was hard to have it
                keep track of where a hit was, where to guess next, and when a
                ship was sunk so that it could move on and randomly guess again.
                It took probably 15 hours to write at least and hundreds of
                lines of code. I am pretty proud of it that I finally got it
                working!

            Include a second HTML5 component. If your first HTML5 component is
            media (audio or video) then your second component can't be a media
            component.

            <hr />
            This means there is both media and canvas elements which qualifies
            for the extra credit.
