**** I loaded the JSON object by using the synchronous XMLHTTREQUEST. I then parsed the JSON Object using JSON.parse(), and assigned the JSON object values to local variables. Then those local variables were used to set up the initial game board for where the ships are. It also shows what player is going first by getting that information from the JSON object and showing it above the table on the game page.
